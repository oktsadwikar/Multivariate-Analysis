## 🐾GUIDELINE🐾
1. The Codes are devided by each topic and written by R-Markdown
2. All the datasets are uploaded in the directory ["Data"](https://github.com/oktsadwikar/Multivariate-Analysis/tree/main/Data)
3. All R-code can be downloaded in the directory ["R-Script"](https://github.com/oktsadwikar/Multivariate-Analysis/tree/main/R-Script)
4. All R-code can be seen in GitHub through following details:

---
### ✨ CHAPTER 1 - Introduction of Multivariate Analysis in R ✨
**Click ->** [Chapter 1](https://github.com/oktsadwikar/Multivariate-Analysis/blob/main/Chapter-1---Introduction-in-Multivariate-Analysis.md)

Chapter 1 explains about the introduction of multivariate analysis in R, like import package, calling the data, and data manipulation.

---


### ✨ CHAPTER 2 - Data Exploration and Normality Test ✨
  **Click ->** [Chapter 2](https://github.com/oktsadwikar/Multivariate-Analysis/blob/main/Chapter-2---Data-Exploration-and-Normality-Test.md)

  Chapter 2 explains about data exploration like check missing value, plots, and multivariate normality test in R

## 💥 FINAL EXAMINATION 💥
### GROUP FINAL EXAMINATION
  **Click ->** [Group Final Examination](https://github.com/oktsadwikar/Multivariate-Analysis/blob/main/GROUP-FINAL-EXAMINATION.md)
  
  This report explain about Classification using Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression Analysis.
    
### INDIVIDUAL FINAL EXAMINATION
  **Click ->** [Individual Final Examination](https://github.com/oktsadwikar/Multivariate-Analysis/blob/main/Individual_Final_Examination.md)

  This is the continuation of the Group Project. Compare the analysis using PCA, so there are 4 analysis:
  * Discriminant Analysis without PCA
  * Discriminant Analysis with PCA
  * Logistic Regression without PCA
  * Logistic Regression with PCA

**Thank You 🙌**
